You have a few options with what you can do here... \n\ \n\ Click on the "Share/Vote" button at the top of the screen to vote on the show, post it to Facebook, or Tweet it. \n\ \n\ If you want to just play a song, click on it.

You can even choose to download the entire show!  If a song is downloaded, a star will appear next to it, and it will play from your phone (instead of from the Internet) if you click on it.  You can also play it by going to "Downloaded Songs" from the home screen. \n\ \n\ If you want to reccomend a song to a friend, long-press on the song and you will have the option to do so.</string>
